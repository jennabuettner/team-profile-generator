# team-profile-generator

The purpose of this project was to create a command line application for a user to generate a list of their employees' profiles.

## Description

Upon initialization, the command line application will ask for the Manager's ID, name, email, and office number. The user is then prompted to choose which type of employee they would like to add whether it be an engineer or an intern. If they select the engineer, they will enter the engineer's ID, name, email, and Github. If they choose intern, they will be prompted to enter the same information but in place of github, they will enter the intern's school. They will be asked if they'd like to any more employees or if they are done. If they are done, they will be presented with an index.html file which, when opened in the browser, will give the user a list of each employee's information on individualized cards.
